# Artificial Intelligence
Project done for the Intelligent Systems subject in which we work on a dataset of African countries in which we made a model that predicts if a given African country is going to have a banking crisis.

The neuralNetwork1.py file was made using the Pybrain package.
The neuralNetwork2.py and decisionTree.py files were made based on the Scikit-Learn package that has proven to be a lot more effective in terms of efficency and quality of results.
