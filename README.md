# Artificial Intelligence
Project done for the Intelligent Systems subject in which we work on a dataset of African countries in which we made a model that predicts if a given African country is going to have a banking crisis.

The neuralNetwork1.py file was made using the Pybrain package.

The neuralNetwork2.py and decisionTree.py files were made based on the Scikit-Learn package that has proven to be a lot more effective in terms of efficency and quality of results.

The file fullDataset.csv contains the following information in its columns:

1 - Systemic Crisis;

2 - Exchange USD;

3 - Domestic Debt;

4 - Sovereign External Debt;

5 - GDP Weighted;

6 - Inflation Annual;

7 - Independence;

8 - Currency Crisis;

9 - Inflation Crisis;

10 - Banking Crisis.
